### Prettier

To maintain some minimal standards within our codebase, we rely on [prettier](https://prettier.io/) that is configured through `.prettierrc`. We use `.prettierignore` to avoid conflicts with some configuration files that would otherwise be broken by using prettier. Make sure prettier is correctly used in VSCode by installing the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).

### Node version

We did set up a `.nvmrc` file to allow developers to quickly change and use the right node version. See [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) package and [deeper shell integration](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#deeper-shell-integration).
